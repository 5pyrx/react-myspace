              <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
              <p>
                I started my engineering journey learning python basics, moving onto Javascript & JQuery and later learning React 16.
                During my role as Innovation Product Manager I was able to assist in the build phase of new product concepts, 
                building user interfaces for blockchain, savings and mortgage journeys.
              </p>
              <p>
                I continued to deepen my knowledge of react, utilising resources such as Robin Weiruch's Road to React, Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller's complete guide and Bruno Simon's Three.js & React-three-fiber.
                And completed a full-stack Javascript software engineering course at Northcoders
